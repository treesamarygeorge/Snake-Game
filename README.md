# Snake-Game




Basic snake game in python using pygame:

Install pygame in your system - "pip install pygame"

If this doesn't work then try this one  = "py -m pip install -U pygame --user"   (or)    "py -m pip install pygame"


Looking into code:
1. Initialize pygame 
2. Set up colours on different roles in the game.
3. Create the window that has to be displayed
4. Define the game title, text screen and the game plot.
5. Establish the game rules and methodologies.


Executing the entire program will pop up the game window that consists of the main roles and actions of the game!!!
Okay then, now it's time to playðŸ˜ƒ
